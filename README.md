# MD_TRAJECTORY_PROCESSING_PRIVATE
Scripts for automating MD simulation trajectory concatenation, alignment, centering, and wrapping (PRIVATE)

Will use this as editing/staging space for scripts which will       
eventually be pushed to a public repo either on my own github or on the  
Latorraca github.                                                   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These scripts are intended to process and monitor Amber simulations
and was originally writter for Amber 24/25
    > Amber25: https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php 
 
Make sure you have access to cpptraj provided by the AmberTools software                                    |
See also cpptraj atom selection formating:
    > https://amberhub.chpc.utah.edu/atom-mask-selection-syntax/ 

Recommended folder organization:                                           
    $CWD/SYSNAME/REPLICA_#                            

And processed output will be places in:                                    
    $CWD/PROCESSED_TRAJS/SYSNAME/REPLICA_#            
                                                                           
* This analysis assumes that you used the same coordinate save rate      
  in all production runs                                                   
                                                                             
* Re-launching SLURM jobs will only work is a SLURM submission file is     
  already present in individual simulation subdirectories.                 
                                                                             
* Also assumes ALL of your simulation output is in one folder    

-------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo should contain the following:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. process_trajs.sh 
        > Save a new NetCDF trajectory by concatenateing seperate simulation trajectories
          with option to adjust save rate, center, align and exclude pre-production data

2. save_snapshots.sh
        > Save a user specifified number of snapshots (single frames) evenly dispersed 
          over the production simulation trajectory.

3. check_simtime.sh
        > Generate a report of ongoing simulation jobs on a SLURM-formated computing cluster
          of only jobs generated by the user 
          There is an option to restart the simulation from the slurm input script
          found in the same folder as the simulation data

4. seed_new_sims.sh
        > Generates a new simulation seeded from a user specified simulation time

5. TEMPLATE_SCRIPTS_FOR_MEMBRANE_SIMULATIONS_Amber24    
        > Folder containing Amber simulation input parameters and SLURM submission script for
          seeded simulations
